# SemiAutoHotKey
I thought to myself - "Hey, I could download Auto HotKey for free with zero repurcussions", or I could make my own separate program that has about a tenth of the features that autohotkey has whilst simultaneously missing out the whole scripting part. 

If you want to run this, download whatever's in the bin/release folder (the .dll's, .xml and .exe) and run the .exe with the other stuff in the same folder on your windows computer (because I used winforms to make this)
