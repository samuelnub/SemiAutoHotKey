# SemiAutoHotKey
I thought to myself - "Hey, I could download Auto HotKey for free with zero repurcussions", or I could make my own separate terrible program that has about a tenth of the features that autohotkey has whilst simultaneously missing out the whole scripting part. 

This program is terrible and you should feel bad about stumbling upon this.

If you want to run this, download whatever's in the bin/release folder (the .dll's, .xml and .exe) and run the .exe with the other stuff in the same folder on your windows computer (because I used winforms to make this)
